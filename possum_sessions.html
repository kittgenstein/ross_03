		<h1>Sessions</h1>
		
			<p>Powerful divinations reveal that the eldritch beings beyond time and space interact with the five through unimaginable interfaces known as &#8220;sessions.&#8221; The eldritch being that some call &#8220;Ross&#8221; and others call the &#8220;Dungeon Master&#8221; names these sessions. I have transcribed them, and for some of them I have scribbled a brief summary.</p>
