			<p>I am [redacted], one of the infinite scribes in the Infinite Archive located at Daanvi. Strange events are transpiring in Eberron, and I have been tasked with tracking those at the center of them.</p>
			
			<p>The prophecy is straining. The marks are not following their trajectories. The Mark of Death has returned, and the Mark of Scribing and Sentinel are not where they ought to be. At all costs, the Infinite Archive must be sustained.</p>

			<p>Five are controlled by eldritch beings beyond the realm of Eberron. These beings call themselves &#8220;players.&#8221; Alphabetically, they are: Angela, Eli, June, Matías, and Will. Those controlled form the Perilous Adventure Society of Morgrave University, and are, respectively:</p>

					<td>This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. &#40;DMG, p. 267.&#41;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Dragonshards and Resource Regeneration</td>
					<td>You can use 1 pound of Red Dragonshards to regain a 1st-level spell slot or a feature/trait that takes a short rest to recover, 2 pounds for a 2nd-level spell slot, 3 pounds for a 3rd-level spell slot or a feature/trait that takes a long rest to recover, and so on with higher-level spell slots. You can do this with the Use an Item action, provided you have the requisite amount of Eberron/Red Dragonshards. If you &#8220;consume&#8221; more pounds of these dragonshards per day than your proficiency bonus, you'll suffer magic poisoning, which has varying effects that grow more severe the further past your limit that you push. &#40;Ross, d. 2020-02-12.&#41;</td>

					<td>Dragonshard Substitution</td>
					<td>In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise &#40;the dust’s market value is the same as the replaced component&#41;. &#40;ERLW 275; Ross d. 2021-01-05.&#41;</td>

However, Dragonmark and magic item abilities work as written, usually regaining their magics each day at dawn. &#40;Ross, d. 2020-12-16.&#41;</td>
